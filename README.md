<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ivan Sryvkin</h1>


<h2 align="center">About me:</h2>
<h3 align="center">Hello! My name is Ivan, and I am 16 years old. I am a young and ambitious full-stack developer from Russia. The world of programming is not just a profession for me; it's a true passion that inspires me to create amazing and innovative things. My specialization is full-stack development, which means I have experience in both frontend and backend when it comes to creating web applications.

On the frontend, I love working with modern technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I am proficient in frameworks like React.js and Redux Toolkit, enabling me to create dynamic and scalable user interfaces. Additionally, I confidently use tools like Scss and Vite for more efficient and structured development. In projects that require server-side rendering, I prefer utilizing Next.js.

On the other hand, on the backend, I am driven by solving complex problems and ensuring the reliability and security of web applications. My preferences include using Node.js and the Express.js framework to create fast and scalable servers. When it comes to working with databases, I prefer using MongoDB for efficient data storage. Recently, I have started to learn and apply the Nest.js framework to create more organized and modular backend applications.

I am gearing up for a long and successful journey in the world of IT and am ready to take on any challenges to reach new heights in my developer career.

I am excited to share my experience, learn new things, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Feel free to get in touch with me, and let's work together to make the world of internet technologies even better !</h3>
